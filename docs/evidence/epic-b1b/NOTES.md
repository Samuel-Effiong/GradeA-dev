# Epic B1b — evidence notes

**Plan:** [08b_b1b_plan_amendment.md](../../phase2/architecture/08b_b1b_plan_amendment.md) ("08b"), approved by the owner 2026-11-09, with the SM's recommendations on Q1–Q11. It amends [08_epic_b1_implementation_plan.md](../../phase2/architecture/08_epic_b1_implementation_plan.md) ("the plan").
**The 16 new texts in 08b §7 are not approved.** Each is built behind its `_APPROVED` constant, set False. No text goes live until the owner approves it.
**Branch:** `task/epic-b1b`, off `origin/staging` 4aff59a43. The first commit, 40d462207, carries 08b in. Staging bc7dd7a89 (H-300) was merged `--no-ff` as 28c0c8a1e: no conflicts, and `makemigrations --check --dry-run` printed "No changes detected" (rc=0).
**Doctrine (08b §8, as updated by the SM 2026-11-09):**
- Every near run carries the full standing guard list, now **66 labels** (08b §8 still says 22; the SM's GO of 2026-11-09 sets 66). Near runs are run serially.
- Runs go under `flock ~/.machine-fullsuite.lock` in `h284_deps_env`, with `free -m` ≥ 4000 MB available.
- There is no full suite. The PG 16 CI runs only on the owner's go.
- Stripe and Cloudinary are always mocked. Nothing is pushed.

## §0. B1b-0: the survey (before any code)

All facts below are at **28c0c8a1e**. The merge changed only `billing/stripe_service.py` among the `.py` files (H-300), and nothing 08b cites lives there.

### §0.1 08b §1.1 line references: re-derived

Every reference in 08b §1.1 holds unchanged (08b cites 240567975):

| What | 08b §1.1 | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `execute_graded_task` / `hold_for_call` | `ai_processor/services.py:5484` / `:5667` | same |
| `estimate_messages_cost` / `estimate_total_token` / `+= 20000` | `:5754` / `:5807` / `:5823` | same |
| `metered_unit(` in grading | `:4637` | same |
| `AICallRecord` | `ai_processor/models.py:254` | same |
| `grade_engine_async` / `grade_batch_async` / `_relaunch_failed_dispatches` / `auto_grade_due_assignment` | `assignments/tasks.py:648` / `:1466` / `:1646` / `:1698` | same; the `_dispatch_tracked_grading(` calls are at `:1542` (in `grade_batch_async`) and `:1758` (auto-grade) |
| `_dispatch_tracked_grading` / `_launch_tracked_grading` | `:1555` / `:1583` | same |
| `grade_all_submission` / its own loop / `schedule_grade_all_submission` / `PeriodicTask` | `assignments/views.py:1791` / `:1812` / `:1872` / `:1896–1903` | same. The ungraded filter is at `:1798` |
| `CreditLedger.record` / `after_bulk_create` | `billing/models.py:1587` / `:1596` | same |
| `refund_credits` / its `bulk_create` | `billing/services.py:1445` / `:1567` | same |
| `total_remaining_credits` / `plan_remaining_credits` | `:762` / `:782` | same (`billing/models.py`) |
| `low_balance_warned_level` / `_cycle_start` | `billing/models.py:724` / `:729` | same |
| `CreditWalletSerializer` | `billing/serializers.py:873` | same |
| `queue_expiry_days` / `queue_expiry_warning_hours` | `billing/models.py:424` / `:429` | same |
| `AIJob` / `BillingSettings` | `:1787` / `:1935` | same. `billing/admin.py` still registers only `StripeEvent` (`:22`) and `LicenseStripeMutationIntent` (`:64`) |
| `AIJobStatus`, eight states | `billing/models.py:165–172` | same (the class is at `:163`) |
| `billing/holds.py` | 1,145 lines; `sweep_stale_holds` `:584` | same |
| Beat entries | `AutoGrader/settings.py:941–950` | same. The comment is at `:941–942`, the sweep at `:943–946` and the invariants at `:948–951`. The sweep entry is always scheduled; the task itself does nothing with the flag off |
| `LATE_DOOR_EMAIL_TEXTS` / `LATE_DOOR_EMAIL_APPROVED = False` | `billing/holds.py:1082` / `:1095` | same |
| The remediation "no `{`" pin | `AutoGrader/tests_reason_codes.py:258` | same |
| `REUPLOAD` | `students/item_retry.py:47–51` | same |
| The `AICallRecord` guard `ALLOWED` | `ai_processor/tests_call_record_static.py` | `:359` |

### §0.2 The plan's entry-point table (plan §3.4, E-1…E-7): re-derived

The plan cites d808a9ce. All seven entry points still exist and none is new; only line numbers moved:

| # | Plan says | Now |
|---|---|---|
| E-1 | `students/views.py:~964`, `assignments/views.py:~1785` launch `grade_engine_async`; unit `ai_processor/services.py:4635` | `students/views.py:996` (also the scheduled `PeriodicTask` at `:1071`); `assignments/views.py:1824` (inside grade-all's own loop); unit `:4637` |
| E-2 | `students/item_retry.py:~151` | `:154` |
| E-3 | `auto_grade_due_assignment` `:1668` (call `:1733`), `_relaunch_failed_dispatches` `:1616` (call `:1662`) | `:1698` (call `:1758`), `:1646` |
| E-4 | `students/views.py:~610` → `upload_answers_engine`; `students/services.py:962` / `:1365` | `students/views.py:632`; `upload_answers_engine` at `students/services.py:1508`, its `metered_unit(` at `:1539`; the grading pipeline's `metered_unit(` at `:1130` (`_run_grading_pipeline`, `:1110`, called from `grade_engine` at `:824`) |
| E-5 | `students/views.py:~794` → `update_submission_from_raw_text`, `students/services.py:1709` | `students/views.py:826`; `update_submission_from_raw_text` `:1844`, its `metered_unit(` `:1884` |
| E-6 | `assignments/tasks.py:~450` | `:452` |
| E-7 | `assignments/upload_door.py:1-5`; `assignments/file_uploads.py:132` | same |

All non-test `metered_unit(` uses: `ai_processor/services.py:4637`, `students/services.py:1130`, `:1539`, `:1884` and `assignments/file_uploads.py:132`. Five in all, matching E-1…E-7.

### §0.3 08b §1.6: AI responses that are not JSON objects, re-derived from every `execute_graded_task` caller

**Method:**
- `execute_graded_task(` has **17 call sites**, all inside `AIProcessor` (`ai_processor/services.py`).
- I mapped each to its enclosing method (AST), then followed every public method to its non-test callers.
- (`billing/testing/holds.py:143` is a test helper.)

| Call site(s) | Method | Reached from |
|---|---|---|
| `:1312`, `:1371`, `:1515`, `:1692` | `extract_assignment`, `extract_assignment_image`, the two chunked extractors | `AssignmentProcessingService.extract_assignment_data` (`assignments/services.py:1033`). That is reached from `update_assignment_from_extraction` (`:1125`, sync views below) and from `assignments/file_uploads.py:136` (async, E-7). The benchmark runner is not a route |
| `:2172`, `:2434`, `:2623`, `:2893` | answer extraction, blank-answer check, second reading | `upload_answers_engine` (sync E-4, async E-7) |
| `:3614`, `:3893`, `:4928` | grading | `grade_engine` → `_run_grading_pipeline` (sync `grade` view; async E-1/E-2/E-3) |
| `:5341` | `generate_assignment_from_prompt` | `assignments/views.py:1489` (sync) |
| `:5448` | `formatted_grade` | `assignments/tasks.py:957`, `:1200` (async only) |
| `:5872` | `custom_ai_prompt` | `billing/views.py:2732`, `dashboard/views.py:208` (sync) |
| `:6025` | `generate_student_summary` | `classrooms/tasks.py:64` (async only) |
| `:6072`, `:6136` | weekly narratives | `dashboard/tasks.py:80`, `:251` (async only) |

**The synchronous AI routes, those that call the provider inside the request (8):**

| Route | View | AI-success body |
|---|---|---|
| Grade one submission | `students/views.py` `grade` `:929` | `Response(serializer.data)` `:945` |
| Student upload | `students/views.py` `upload_answers` `:589` | `Response(serializer.data)` `:655` |
| Raw-text edit | `students/views.py` `partial_update` `:805` | `Response(serializer.data)` `:842` |
| Create assignment (extraction) | `assignments/views.py` `create` `:418` | `Response(serializer.data)` `:476` |
| Edit assignment (re-extraction) | `assignments/views.py` `partial_update` `:610` | `Response(serializer.data)` `:674` |
| Generate an assignment | `assignments/views.py` `generate_assignment_from_prompt` `:1440` | `Response(data)` at `:1560` and `:1593`; `data` is a dict built at the call site |
| Custom AI prompt | `billing/views.py` `custom_ai_prompt` `:2603` | `Response(serializer.data)` `:2752` (`CustomAIReply`) |
| Dashboard AI chat | `dashboard/views.py` `run_dashboard_ai_chat` `:193` | `Response(CustomAIReply(...).data)` `:242` |

**Result: 0 AI-success bodies that are not JSON objects.** That matches 08b's first-pass count. `ai_job_id` can be added to all eight.

**Corrections to 08b §1.6's first pass (the count does not change):**
1. `teacher_feedback` (`:1105`), `update_grade` (`:1185`) and `classrooms` `student_summary` (`:1824`) are **not** synchronous AI routes. They dispatch Celery tasks (`formatted_grade_async`, `generate_student_summary`), so their response carries no AI result, and the job id comes from the task.
   - The non-AI bare-string branch is still at `students/views.py:1161` ("Submission has not be graded yet"). It stays untouched, because it is not an AI body.
2. The first pass missed **four** synchronous AI routes: assignment `create`, `generate_assignment_from_prompt`, `custom_ai_prompt` and the dashboard chat. All four return JSON objects.
3. **For information:**
   - Assignment `create` has no `HasCreditBalance` permission. The viewset uses `(IsAuthenticated, IsTeacherOrReadOnly)`, and only `partial_update` checks inline at `:620`.
   - With the flag on, its provider calls are still held. Outside a metered unit, `hold_for_call` (`billing/holds.py:1018`) opens a single-call job (`begin_single_call`), and with the flag off, today's balance check in `execute_graded_task` applies.
   - So there is no B1b change, but B1b-4's estimate endpoint and the `ai_job_id` work must treat these single-call routes as their own case.

### §0.4 The Cloudinary private-type spike (08b §3.2)

**Question:** can `django-cloudinary-storage`'s `RawMediaCloudinaryStorage` upload with `type="private"` or `"authenticated"`?
**Method:** I read the installed code (`django-cloudinary-storage==0.3.0`, `cloudinary==1.44.1`, both pinned in `requirements.txt:37`, `:25`). No network call was made.

**Answer: no. `students/kept_files.py` calls the Cloudinary SDK directly,** as 08b §3.2 allows. The storage class can't be used here, for these reasons:
- `MediaCloudinaryStorage._upload` builds fixed options: `use_filename=True`, `resource_type`, `tags` and `folder`. There is no way to pass `type`, so every upload is `type="upload"`, which is **public**.
- `use_filename=True` puts the original file name into the public id. 08b requires that the name never contain it.
- `_open` and `exists` fetch the asset's **unsigned delivery URL** with `requests.get` or `requests.head`. That would fail for a private asset, and it is a URL fetch, not an authenticated API call.
- `RawMediaCloudinaryStorage` only overrides `RESOURCE_TYPE`.

**What the SDK offers, and what `kept_files.py` will use** (all present in 1.44.1):
- **Store:** `cloudinary.uploader.upload(file, public_id="kept_uploads/<uuid>", resource_type="raw", type="private", overwrite=False)`. The SDK passes `type` through as an upload parameter: it is in `__SIMPLE_UPLOAD_PARAMS` (`cloudinary/utils.py:77`, entry at `:82`), which `build_upload_params` (`:1157`) reads.
- **Load:** `cloudinary.utils.private_download_url(public_id, format, resource_type="raw", type="private", expires_at=now+300)` (`utils.py:992`). This is a signed API download URL, fetched server-side by the worker only and never sent to a browser. The worker then checks the bytes' sha256.
- **Delete:** `cloudinary.uploader.destroy(public_id, resource_type="raw", type="private", invalidate=True)` (`uploader.py:340`). `type` must match the upload.
- **Configuration:** already done. `cloudinary_storage` and `cloudinary` are in `INSTALLED_APPS` (`settings.py:372–373`), and `cloudinary_storage/app_settings.py:32–40` calls `cloudinary.config(...)` from `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` (`settings.py:1212`). Those are three required env values, so they are set wherever the app boots.

**`type="private"` rather than `"authenticated"`:** both refuse public delivery. A private asset is reachable only through the signed API download, so a leaked delivery URL can't fetch it. An authenticated asset can be delivered by a signed delivery URL. **Proposal: `private`**, because nothing in F4 needs delivery URLs.

**A correction to 08b §3.2 (no design change):**
- 08b cites "Cloudinary STORAGES at `settings.py:1190`" as the storage the project already uses. In fact `STORAGES["default"]` is `MediaCloudinaryStorage` only when `ENVIRONMENT` is `prod`, `dev` or `local` (`settings.py:1189–1206`); any other value gets `FileSystemStorage`.
- `ENVIRONMENT` accepts only those three values (`:131`, `:148`), and beta runs as `prod`. **Staging's `ENVIRONMENT` value is not in git [UNVERIFIED].**
- `kept_files.py` doesn't depend on `STORAGES` either way. It calls the SDK, which is configured from `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` in every environment. So "storage measured on staging" (B1b-5) works whatever staging's `ENVIRONMENT` is.

**Tests:** every test uses a fake in place of the three SDK calls. `AutoGrader/tests_network_guard.py` exists and blocks real network calls, and `BENCHMARK_ARCHIVE_ENABLED` is off under test (`settings.py:1619–1620`), which is the precedent.

### §0.5 Other 08b references checked

- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES = 50 MB`: `AutoGrader/uploads.py:45`.
- `build_async_upload_payload` / `rebuild_uploaded_file`: `assignments/services.py:703` / `:714`.
- `MAX_ROWS = 2000`: `classrooms/services/roster_import.py:50`.
- Worker concurrency default 4: `scripts/start-worker.sh:8–9`.

### §0.6 The B1b-0 result

- **No STOP.**
- Every 08b §1.1 reference and every E-table entry point is confirmed. The E-table line numbers are updated above.
- The non-JSON count is 0. The list of synchronous AI routes is corrected to 8.
- The spike settles 08b §3.2's [UNVERIFIED] item: the SDK is called directly, with `type="private"`.

**Next:** a checkpoint with the SM before B1b-1 (FB-1).
